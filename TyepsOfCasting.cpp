// there are two types of casting in cpp
// 1. implicit casting (when casting is done by the compiler it is mainly of )
// 2. explicit casting (when casting done for userdefined data types with minimum data loss or no data loss)
// a) static casting -> casting is done at compile time
// b) dynamic casting -> when we want to cast base class refrence to derived class
// c) reinterprit casting -> used to reinterpret memory of a variable as a different data types
// d)const_cast: Used to add or remove const qualifiers
